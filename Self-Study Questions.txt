1.Describe the biggest difference between .forEach & .map.
  The biggest difference is that forEach() allows the mutation of the original array, 
  while map() returns a new array of the same size. map() is also faster. 
  But it is entirely up to you to decide which one works better for you.

2.What is the difference between a function and a method?
  A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to 
  operate on (the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value).
  All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed. 
  A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object.

3.What is closure?
  Closure is a feature in JavaScript where a function has access to its own scope variables, 
  access to the outer function variables and access to the global variables. 
  Closure has access to its outer function scope even after the outer function has returned.

4.Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
  a. Is the function called by new?
  b. Is the function called by call(), apply(), or bind()?
  c. Is the function called as a method, ie: obj.func()?
  d. Is the function called in the global scope?

5.Why do we need super() in an extended class?
  The super keyword in JavaScript is used in order to call the methods of the parent class.
  By itself, super() is used within a constructor function to call the parent constructor function.
